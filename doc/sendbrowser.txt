https://github.com/januswel/jwlib.vim/blob/master/autoload/jwlib/os.vim

The command ":TOhtml" is also needed but it is distributed as a standard
plugin.

PROVIDES						*sendbrowser-provides*

Mappings:
<Leader>vh or <Plug>SendBrowser
	Shows all contents of the current buffer in system-default web
	browser.  It is convenient to hard-copy when there is a difference
	between a value of 'encoding' and valid one for your printer.

Commands:
:[range]SendBrowser
	Same as <Leader>vh or <Plug>SendBrowser but can be specified [range]
	to show.

SETTINGS						*sendbrowser-settings*

This is a wrapper for ":TOhtml", so its settings are available.  See
|:TOhtml|.

DISABLES						*sendbrowser-disables*

Variables:
g:loaded_sendbrowser
	When exists, does nothing.  Use to disable this plugin.

g:no_sendbrowser_maps
	When non-zero, doesn't register any effective mappings.

g:no_plugin_maps
	When non-zero, doesn't register any effective mappings.  This variable
	may have an affect on mappings of other plugins.  Use
	"g:no_sendbrowser_maps" to disable only mappings of this plugin.
